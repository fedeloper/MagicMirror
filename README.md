To better understand what could be our place in market, we conducted both:

● surveys

̴ 60

● interviews

Surveys

● there’s a trend passing from traditional reading to e-reading

● Audiobooks are listened mostly on smartphones

● Audiobooks are preferred when a regular book cannot be read

● people that **do not** listen to Audiobooks would use a smartphone

● Story Genre is the most important factor for the story selection

● Audiobooks can be an useful tool for educational purposes

● traditional reading is preferred over e-reading

● Audiobooks are listened mostly on smartphones

● Audiobooks are preferred even when a book can be read

● people that **do not** listen to Audiobooks would use a smartphone

● Story Genre is the most important factor for the story selection

Interviews

● readings by others (parents, babysitters, ...) are remembered with great joy

● the family chooses the stories to read

● nowaday, almost no one reads for other people

● many people read more for pleasure as a child than they do now

● there exists reading groups and public reading events

● listen to a divulgative book/article requires more attention than reading it
